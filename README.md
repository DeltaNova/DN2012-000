# DN2012-000 -I2C Experiment Board
http://www.deltanova.co.uk/electronics/dn2012-000/

In 2012 I created a little I2C experiment board comprising of a real time clock (with battery backup), a temperature sensor and some EEPROM. The intent was to connect the board up to an Arduino and have a play about. This repo contains the results of my ongoing experimentation.
